## Slack

[Install Slack for Linux (beta)](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212924728-Slack-for-Linux-beta-).

Launch the app and sign in to `lewagon-alumni` organization.

Make sure you upload a picture there.

You can also sign in to Slack on your iPhone or Android device!

The idea is that you'll have Slack open all day, so that you can share useful links / ask for help / decide where to go to lunch / etc.

In case of remote tickets, you will use Slack audio or video call to get help. To ensure that everything is working fine, launch the Slack app on your computer, then [follow this procedure](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/115003538426-Troubleshoot-Slack-Calls#run-our-calls-test) (tl;dr type `/call --test` then the `Enter` key in any channel).

After the test are finished, you should have green "All clear" messages at least for your microphone and camera. If not, ask a teacher.
